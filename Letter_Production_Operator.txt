Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Production Operator position at Ray‑Mont Logistics. With over five years in high‑speed manufacturing and operations roles, I deliver the safe, reliable and efficient handling your team needs: I proactively perform routine inspections and basic equipment maintenance to minimize downtime, follow strict safety and QA protocols (GMP/HACCP/OHS), and am experienced with long shift schedules and high‑pressure production environments.

My hands‑on mechanical background and history of troubleshooting both legacy and automated systems means I can quickly support loading/unloading workflows, safely operate and learn powered equipment (forklifts/bobcats), and keep materials moving while protecting product quality. I consistently enforce PPE and safety procedures, report issues promptly to maintenance, and prioritize meeting deadlines during busy shifts — directly addressing Ray‑Mont’s needs for quality, flexibility and performance on 12‑hour rotations and in all weather conditions.

I am authorized to work in Canada, hold a valid driver’s license and have my own vehicle. I am willing to relocate to Prince Rupert at my own expense and have a realistic plan to secure housing prior to a start date; I can be available to begin work in approximately two months. I am also seeking long‑term immigration support and would appreciate any assistance Ray‑Mont can offer in that process. I will of course complete all pre‑hire checks, including a criminal background check.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Ray‑Mont’s operations and am happy to provide any further information or references upon request.

Sincerely,
Ruslan Kulikov
